## Table Of Contents

### Tutorials

* [Gradient Descent](https://github.com/ahmealy/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/2.Neural-Networks/L1.Introduction-to-neural-networks/gradient-descent): Implementing Gradient Descent.
* [Backpropagation](https://github.com/ahmealy/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/2.Neural-Networks/L1.Introduction-to-neural-networks/student-admissions): Implementing backpropagation step, scaling and one hot encoding to the data.
* [Gradient Descent with Mean Square Error](https://github.com/ahmealy/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/2.Neural-Networks/L2.Implementing-gradient-descent/gradient-descent-MeanSquareError): Implementing Gradient Descent with Mean Square Error.
* [Multilayer Perceptrons backpropagation](https://github.com/ahmealy/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/2.Neural-Networks/L2.Implementing-gradient-descent/Multilayer-Perceptrons-backpropagation): Implementing multi layer perceptrons backpropagation.
* [Sentiment Analysis with Numpy](https://github.com/ahmealy/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/2.Neural-Networks/L5.Sentiment%20Analysis/sentiment-analysis-network): [Andrew Trask](http://iamtrask.github.io/) leads you through building a sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text (films review) is positive or negative.
* [Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://github.com/ahmealy/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/2.Neural-Networks/L7.Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch/intro-to-pytorch): Introduction to deep learning with PyTorch.
* [Transfer Learning (ConvNet)](https://github.com/ahmealy/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/3.Convolutional-Neural-Networks/L4.Transfer-Learning/transfer-learning). In practice, most people don't train their own large networkd on huge datasets, but use pretrained networks such as VGGnet. Here you'll use VGGnet to classify images of flowers without training a network on the images themselves.
* [Weight Intialization](https://github.com/ahmealy/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/3.Convolutional-Neural-Networks/L5.Weight-Initialization/weight-initialization): Explore how initializing network weights affects performance.
* [Autoencoders](https://github.com/ahmealy/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/3.Convolutional-Neural-Networks/L6.Auto-Encoders/autoencoder): Build models for image compression and denoising, using feed-forward and convolution networks in TensorFlow.
* [Style Transfer](https://github.com/ahmealy/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/3.Convolutional-Neural-Networks/L7.Style-Transfer/style-transfer): Use a pre-trained network to extract content and style features from an image.

### Projects
* [Your First Neural Network](https://github.com/ahmealy/Deep-Learning-Nanodegree-Udacity/tree/master/2.Neural-Networks/Project.Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns): Implement a neural network in Numpy to predict bike rentals.


## Dependencies

Each directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory.

### pip

To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

### Conda Environments

You can find Conda environment files for the Deep Learning program in the `environments` folder. Note that environment files are platform dependent. Versions with `tensorflow-gpu` are labeled in the filename with "GPU".
